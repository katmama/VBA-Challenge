# VBA-Challenge
VBA Homework
My homework assignment was to write a VBA code that had the following instructions:

Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:


The ticker symbol.


Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.


The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.


The total stock volume of the stock.


Note: Make sure to use conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.


This was tough all around, but the biggest challenge I faced was trying to figure out how to reset the open stock price for new ticker. Setting the initial open price as a variable outside the loop and then making sure to add + 1 to row at the end was the solve.
